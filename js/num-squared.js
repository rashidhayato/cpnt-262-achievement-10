// Step 1: Declare function
const num = 4;
const square = function( num ) {
  
  const numSquared = num * num;
  
  console.log(`${num} squared is ${numSquared}.`);
};
// Refactor the following code into a function so that it:
// 1. accepts a the num variable as a parameter;

// 2. squares the num and returns it as a complete sentence;

square ( num )
// 3. logs the returned squared num to the console, from outside the function.


// This console log should log the returned value from outside the function


// console.log(`${num} squared is ${numSquared}.`);
